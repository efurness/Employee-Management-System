# DESCRIPTION 

This is a command line application running on NODE JS and takes user input to output a series of tables for an employment database using a mysql connection. An async function was used to initialize application followed by a prompt for user to select to view a series of tables including departments, roles and employees with a switch statement prompting each question.  The program worked well with the view prompts and SELECT all queries, and additionally to add a department, however to add employees and roles was difficult to complete because even though they followed the switch statements for each of them, the const variables were greyed out.  That is a work in progress.

# INSTALLATION 

NODE JS, INQUIRER, Express, SQL were used.

# USAGE 

General usage for building an employement management system with employees, departments and roles.
 
# LICENSE 

Open source license

# CONTRIBUTING 

SOLO PROJECT

# TESTS 

Tests were run to establish all the various sql queries.
 
# QUESTIONS 

My challenges for this project was to get the tests to function correctly, mainly to get file paths and get methods to pass.  It is quite a complex project to get all the files to work together, to have tests pass, and a lot of repetitive work with each of the subclasses.
