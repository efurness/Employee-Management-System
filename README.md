# DESCRIPTION 

This is a command line application running on NODE JS, Express and mySQL.  The project used Inquirer to take user input to output a series of tables for an employment database using a mysql connection. An async function was used to initialize the application followed by prompts for user to select to view a series of tables including departments, roles and employees with a switch statement prompting each question.  The program worked well with the views prompts and using SELECT all queries, and also successful in adding a department and employees, however adding roles and managers were complex and difficult to complete.  

# INSTALLATION 

NODE JS, INQUIRER, Express, SQL were used.

# USAGE

# LICENSE

# CONTRIBUTING 

SOLO PROJECT

# TESTS 

Tests were run to establish all the various sql queries.
 
# QUESTIONS 

After setting up the database and tables in the schema file my challenges were with the adding of roles including managers. The server.js file contained all the questions and prompts so the code was extensive.  The seeds file went well once I had all the name strings in quotes, parenthesis and commas in the right place, very detailed work.  I had to use a separate port than 3001 because the connection notified that it was inaccesible.
