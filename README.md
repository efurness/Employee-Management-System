# DESCRIPTION 

This is a command line application running on NODE JS and Express and using Inquirer to take user input to output a series of tables for an employment database using a mysql connection. An async function was used to initialize application followed by a prompt for user to select to view a series of tables including departments, roles and employees with a switch statement prompting each question.  The program worked well with the view prompts and SELECT all queries, and additionally to add a department, however to add employees and roles was difficult to complete because even though they followed the switch statements for each of them, the const variables were greyed out.  That is a work in progress.

# INSTALLATION 

NODE JS, INQUIRER, Express, SQL were used.

# USAGE 

General usage for building an employement management system with employees, departments and roles.
 
# LICENSE 

Open source license

# CONTRIBUTING 

SOLO PROJECT

# TESTS 

Tests were run to establish all the various sql queries.
 
# QUESTIONS 

My challenges for this project were mainly to set up the database and tables in the schema having the class activities as a basis.  The server.js file contained all the questions and prompts so the code was extensive.  The seeds file went well once I had all the name strings in quotes and parenthesis and commas in the right place, very detailed work.
